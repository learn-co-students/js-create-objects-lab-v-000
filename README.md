# Creating Pets

## Objectives

- Build constructor functions
- Build objects with properties from a constructor function

## Intro

You work at a pet store, and it's your job to update the website with all the new animals that come into the store.

## Instructions

Create a constructor function for each of the following:

- Dog with `name`, `breed`, and `age` properties
- Cat with `name`, `breed`, and `age` properties
- Ferret with `name`, `age`, and `foodRequirements` properties
- Bird with `name` and `breed` properties
- Fish with `name`, `species`, and `waterConditions` properties

Make sure you run the tests to make sure your solutions work as expected.
